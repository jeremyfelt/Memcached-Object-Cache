Memcached Object Cache (Forked)
======================

Memcached Object Cache is a WordPress plugin available on the official WordPress.org plugin repository - http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/memcached/

This is a fork of that plugin. I hope to keep it up to date with trunk on the original, but with the tweaks necessary to use successfully in various production environments.

Use the original, unless you're having troubles. :)
